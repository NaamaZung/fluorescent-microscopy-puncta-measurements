# fluorescent-microscopy-puncta-measurements
An open source tool for measurements of foci in microscopy images. 

The goal of this project is an easy-to-use software that will receive as an input a series of TIF images that contain several cells and will be able to:
* Mark the cells
* In each marked cell, calculate the number of puncta (using image analysis) and export this output to a spreadsheet file. 

The user may adjust the threshold to define the puncta, and the number of cells to mark in the image.
